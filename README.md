# Are all behavioral reward benefits created equally? An EEG-fMRI study. The code behind the paper

This repository contains the R scripts and Matlab batches that were used to do the main analyses presented in the manuscript Are all behavioral reward benefits created equally? An EEG-fMRI study. 

Please note that the scripts might not be runnable per se (i.e., the code is version-specific). The code serves the interested reader as a source to reconstruct all steps of the analysis used in the paper.
